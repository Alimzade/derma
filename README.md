This is a  **React Native** project for **Dermatological** Illness classifier
# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup]

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

in this case we use Expo, to be able to run IOS emulator without Xcode.

```bash
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
enter 'a' in terminal
```

### For iOS

```bash
npx expo run:ios

# or if you have no Xcode, download Expo Go and scan QR code that appears on terminal
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

-- Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.


## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App.
